            React performance optimization involves several key strategies that
            can significantly improve your application's speed and user
            experience.
        </p>
        <h4>Key Techniques:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>React.memo</strong> for component memoization
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lazy loading</strong> with Suspense
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bundle optimization</strong> with code splitting
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Consider using useMemo and useCallback hooks for expensive
            calculations and function references to prevent unnecessary
            re-renders.

        <h4>Essential Practices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Always define interfaces for your data structures</li>
            <li>Use union types for flexibility</li>

            </code>
        </div>
        <p>

            Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique for solving optimization
            problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems.
        </p>
        <h4>Core Concepts:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Optimal Substructure:</strong> Optimal solution can be
                constructed from optimal solutions of subproblems
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Overlapping Subproblems:</strong> Same subproblems are
                solved multiple times
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Approaches:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Memoization (Top-Down):</strong> Store results of
                subproblems
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tabulation (Bottom-Up):</strong> Build solution
                iteratively
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div
            style={{
